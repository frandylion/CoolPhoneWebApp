Server files can be found in phone_app/server.js, and each web page file can be found in the phone_app/public directory. The server accesses a database called 'phone' on localhost and the code for generating the tables in that database can be found in phone.sql. The ER model is described in er_model.png which is generated using the mermaid script er_model_mermaid.mmd.
